### This analysis is part of the Wesleyan University's Data Analysis course. Thanks Lisa Dierker for putting through the course.
I have selected gapminder dataset for the analysis. I am interested to see how Suicide (per 100,000 people) correlates with inflation (annual %). I believe there will be a direct correlation between the two -as the inflation rises, suicides go up. Both of these variables are not part of the cookbook. I have decided to download the datasets from the Gapminder website myself. Also, unfortunately, there is no consolidated dataset having all the variables at one place. I am going to, as a part of my analysis, download all the 519 variables and consolidate the information.  I have already begun parsing all the data spreadsheets. 
I make available the gapminder dataset with all 519 variables. I beleive this will help others have all the data at place and help correlate various variables at once. Here is my github (repo)[https://github.com/snamburi3/gapminder] for this project. I am presently doing the data ETL work - mainly cleaning and transforming the dataset into tidy format. I have not developed a full research question yet. Once I have all the varirables, I want to see if I can develop a question from the dataset.
