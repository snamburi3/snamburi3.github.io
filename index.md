# About Me

I am a Bioinformatics Software Engineer at SRA International. Currently, I am working on the ISB-CGC project, whose goal is to build tools to analyse TCGA datasets in the cloud. My recent interest is in data science - machine learning, data analysis, and statistics. I am taking various courses related to data science from Coursera and EdX; and this blog is to share my analysis with the community as I learn. Please feel free to comment or critique - all very helpful in my learning.
